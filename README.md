## Frontend of the Blockchain Project (D'app)

- Building Wesbite with web3
- Must have a folder for the smart contracts(Backend)
- Must have a folder for frontend - Html/Javascript

This is the visual barebones of the blockchain project
i've been working on.
Disregard the lack of styling, more interested on how i can build
the visual side of the project in relation to the backend
